# Hi! I'm Alessandro Rocchi ðŸ‘‹

A Computer Science graduate from the University of Milan-Bicocca, I've developed a strong passion for Data Science, particularly in clinical data analysis with the goal of identifying and predicting future medical risks in patients.
My academic journey culminated in a thesis focused on the study and application of unsupervised clustering algorithms, with a specific emphasis on DBSCAN, for the analysis of healthcare data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs).

I've expanded my expertise with practical projects, including the development of a product recommendation system based on clustering algorithms (KNN) and user-based/item-based approaches. Furthermore, I developed a Business Intelligence project for analyzing an S&P 500 stock portfolio, covering returns, correlations, price forecasting with models like ARIMA, Alpha and Beta calculation, Exposure to Fama-French risks, CAPM, and CPPI/Equal Weights strategies.

Previously, I gained experience as a Full Stack Developer, working with technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, ReactJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postman, which provides me with a solid foundation in understanding software architectures."


### ðŸ”Ž What are my goals and what I'm looking for?

Currently, I am actively seeking a Data Science Internship in Madrid to gain practical work experience in data science and related fields (Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Business Intelligence). My aim is to apply all the knowledge acquired during my university studies and continue my professional and personal growth."
I am eager to absorb knowledge, gain practical experience, and collaborate to build impactful data-driven products and solutions. I'm excited to explore opportunities where I can contribute my skills.
